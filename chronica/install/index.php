        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        Welcome to the installation starter page. Make sure you have at <strong>PHP 5.4</strong>  or newer, and <strong>MySQL 5.5</strong> or newer installed on your server first. If your PHP or MySQL is an older version, this might still work, but there's no way to guarantee it.
        </p>
        <p>
        After you successfully run the installer, please delete or remove read access (chmod 000) to the <strong>/install/</strong> directory to be extra safe.
        </p>
